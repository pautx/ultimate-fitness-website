    <p>We have no high-pressure sales people!<img class="right" id="personal-trainer" src="images/personal-trainer.jpg" alt="Personal trainer helping our members"/></p>
    <p>Our membership packages are flexible so you can sign up for a shorter term and not be locked into a long-term commitment. The people who sign you up are the same people you'll see every time you come in to work out.</p>
    <p>Many of our member service representatives are also certified fitness trainers. This makes our staff able to help you whenever you need it, not just by appointment.</p>
